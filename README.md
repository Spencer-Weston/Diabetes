### Notes

* Initialize Git repo (yay, we did it)
* Xamarin-based data collection app for initial data set, prototype to future user interface
* Storing initial data set: easy way to start is to use a text file (CSV) on server instance, eventually use database instance (need server instance eventually anyway)
* Cloud-based app service with Python code (AWS or Azure -- AWS is freer, Azure is better integrated for Xamarin)
