## Form Demo

To start the server:

```
node main.js
```

Currently, server hosts on port 3000.
This may be changed in **main.js**.
To access the site, go to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).

Currently, the form consists of a simple string field.
The string once submitted is appended to a file **data_file.txt** located on the server in the same directory as the main script and HTML form code.

## Next Steps

* modify form data in HTML code to take useful information
* include time component in submission (default to current time unless user specifies)
* modify **main.js** to write updated form input to data file
