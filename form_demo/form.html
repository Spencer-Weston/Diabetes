Blood Glucose:<br>

// NOTE: the slice was used to convert from the ISO string I was getting to a format used by the HTML element
// I'm not sure the ISO string format I was getting is always gauranteed across browsers
// This seems to work for me but should be flagged as something to change later to make sure it always works
